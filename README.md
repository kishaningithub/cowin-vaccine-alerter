# Co-WIN vaccine alerter
This project is a telegram bot which alerts when vaccination slot is available.

## Background
When I tried to book normally or with the help of other telegram bots that are out there, there was a considerable lag between the time
when the slot is available and when the notification is received. This is primarily due to the limitations imposed by the Cowin public API

## Features
- [x] Alerts for 18+ for Chennai,Tamilnadu - https://t.me/joinchat/sew-FrT6W9U0NDhl
