## Background
This is basically a result of my frustration when i tried booking normally via the Co-Win app. The slots go out like hot cakes(in a matter of 10 seconds ðŸ¤¯) and i cannot sit refreshing the same schedule screen all day long to know when slots are avaiable so i started looking out for options and did find a lot of telegram groups which solve this but what is see is there a considerable lag between the time when the slot gets available vs when the notification is received. Given the insane ~10 second window these were not worthwile. Upon digging i figured that is primarily due to the limitations imposed by the Cowin public API
